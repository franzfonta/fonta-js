Lezione 0 - intro (20')
- (re)learn the language
- just the language (no APIs, frameworks or technologies)

- js as implemented spec:
  - many implementors (Mozilla, Apple, Microsoft, Google, Opera, ...)
  - libraries and community
  - influencers (eg: DC)
- js as a low-level language
- understand existing code but write better:
  - past: ES5
  - present: ES6 (Babel, polyfills)
  - future: ES7 (sometimes reliable, sometimes not)
- huge amounts of open code: good and bad
- know glitches to avoid them
- main features:
  - weakly and dinamically typed
  - fp vs oop (prototypal inheritance, OLOOâ€ŠObjects Linking to Other Objects)
  - easy to pick up and (too much) forgiving
- strict mode
  - to activate in old code, already activated in new code
  - Converting mistakes into errors (unexpected behavior or no-op)
    - Setting a value to an undeclared variable
  - Simplifying variable uses
  - Making eval and arguments simpler
  - "Securing" JavaScript

Lezione 1 - variables (15')
- var -> let -> const
- let
  - introduces block scope

- functions as data

Lezione 3 - object basics
- set of properties (name,value)
- objects are dynamic
